# Projects

**32 Bit RISC-V Processor**  
*May - June 2024*  
- Designed a single-cycle RISC-V processor in Verilog, incorporating essential components such as ALU, control unit, instruction memory, program counter, register file, and data memory.
- Executed the RISC-V RV32I instruction set, covering R-type, I-type, and S-type instructions, for RV32I Base Integer Instructions.
- Developed multiple test cases to test and verify the functionality of each instruction type, integrated datapath elements and control logic using Verilog.

**32 Bit MAX Circuit**  
*April 2024*  
- Created a sequential circuit to find the maximum value among eight 4-bit numbers (X0..X7), utilizing a counter and memory elements for continuous tracking over multiple clock cycles.
- Developed a 2-bit counter, data selector, sorter unit, and memory file. The sorter unit compared and swapped inputs to determine the maximum value iteratively.
- Validated the circuit through simulations, achieving accurate maximum value determination within four clock cycles, supported by detailed transistor-level schematics.

**32-Bit Sorting Circuit**  
*March 2024*  
- Devised an 8-input (4-bit) sorting circuit in Cadence Virtuoso using a bottom-up strategy, improving sorting efficiency by 25%.
- Designed a Comparator Circuit for bit-wise A-B comparison, generating signals for greater than, less than, and equal conditions, and a Swapping Circuit to rearrange inputs in descending order, reducing sorting time by 15%.
- Achieved a worst-case delay of 1.8ns and power consumption of 4mW, ensuring a high-performance and energy-efficient design.

**Advanced Logic Gate Optimization for Enhanced Performance in Digital Circuits**  
*May 2024*  
- Constructed a combinational circuit to implement a complex Boolean expression with eight digital inputs (A-H) and one output (Y). The initial design utilized fundamental logic gates such as AND, OR, and NOT.
- Applied three key optimization techniques: CMOS gate sizing, alternative logic structures, and complex CMOS gates.
- Achieved reductions in worst-case delay (73%) and power consumption (70%) through optimized design, resulting in a decrease from 0.38 ns to 0.1 ns in delay and from 0.07 mW to 0.02 mW in power consumption.

**8x3 Bit Priority Encoder**  
*March 2021*  
- Formulated the encoder logic at the register-transfer level (RTL) using Verilog HDL, reducing development time by 30%.
- Employed the priority encoder’s logic at behavioral, structural, and gate levels, and wrote a comprehensive test bench.
